# Project notes
### Game
- Snake but with guns
- Each piece gives your snake a different ability (colour)
- Shoot snake makes tail fall off
- Can use for your own snake

### Error Log
- Whenever a player leave or they restart their tab, then a player charactor is left in it's original position and a new player charactor is created.
- Players only update when their tab is active, so if a tab is minimized or closed, the player is entirely still
- Player speed is dependent on the number of requests the browser makes per second, meaning lower rate browsers and slow internet speeds effect play speed movement.

### Optimizations and potential changes
